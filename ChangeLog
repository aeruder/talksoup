 * I am a retard.  I did not realize that outlets do not have an automatic
   retain when assigned to the instance variable.  Therefore I should be
   releasing those things either!  The only reason it worked was due to a
   GNUstep mem-leak.  I am a retard!

   without an explicit directory given on the /dcc get line.
