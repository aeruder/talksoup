 * TalkSoup 1.0alpha 

2005-07-14 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * GNUstepOutput/BundlePreferences: Moved help text to external file,
 corrected help text.  Corrected NSTableView handling...

 * GNUstepOutput/Misc: Added code to debug NSView hierarchies

 * GNUstepOutput: Complete overhaul of NSTextView initializations, fixing
 of some corrupted gorms, making text field take on chat font, and other 
 bug fixes.
 
2005-07-12 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * GNUstepOutput
   NetclassesInput: Made changes to allow default quit message to work
   when quitting the app, closing a window, and /quit.

2005-07-07 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * GNUstepOutput: Moved to using distributed notifications instead of 
 distributed objects.
 * GNUstepOutput: Fix autoresize of nickview
 * GNUstepOutput: Fix tab completion picking up noncommand commandTyping:

2005-06-27 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * GNUstepOutput: The NSTextField was much too much of a pain to use anymore.
 I've replaced the typing view full out with a KeyTextView which I think will
 also allow OS X to work sanely.

2005-06-26 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * GNUstepOutput: On OS X focusing a textfield causes the action to be sent.
 This was causing the messages to be sent everytime the window was made key.
 Instead I am now trapping the key in the field editor so that it works 
 correctly on OS X and GNUstep.

2005-06-25 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * GNUstepOutput: Fixed serverlist focusing issues.  When you remove a server
 it won't always scroll to the top.

 * GNUstepOutput: Added 5 .nibs (special thanks to Aaron Glenn for doing this
 over IRC ;)

2005-06-24 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * GNUstepOutput: There was a bug in the sorting code for the userlist.
 
 The place for typing will now retain it's position when tabs are changed/
 windows are taken from being key.

2005-06-22 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * IRCSwarm: Updating to allow time constraints (to adjust time between
 events) and correct case on nicknames.

 * GNUstepOutput: Using bold font correctly.  (It was only appropriately
 applied when the preferences were updated.)

 Removed caching (over complicated logic) from NSAttributedString.

 Several bug fixes in TabMasterController.m along the way to reenabling
 the select previous/next tab/close tab buttons on the menu. (which now
 work)

 * TalkSoup.app: I am a fricking retard.  I had doubleReleaseCheck on.
 Yes.  That is why it was slow.  I... am... a... retard.
 
 Retard
 Retard
 Retard

 TalkSoup is fast again.

2005-06-20 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * All: Additional header changes/code tweaks to allow clean compilation
 on OS X.  (Still no .nib files though... :-/)
 
 * All: Improvements on reducing autorelease usage.

 * GNUstepOutput: Force use of NSMessagePort even when the default is
 something else.

2005-06-17 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * Testing: Added a IRCSwarm testing tool that can replay preprocessed
 xchat logs (perl scripts can be easily written to process any type of log).
 It will connect to a server and more or less replay those logs.  Useful for
 debugging large amounts of messages.
 
2005-06-13 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * All: Filled in lots of headers that will be needed for
 OS X compilation.  Fixed relative paths in GNUmakefile.preambles
 in Output/GNUstepOutput and Input/NetclassesInput.

 * GNUstepOutput: /topic command works again, fixed topic inspector to
 stop double querying the topic.

2005-06-12 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * GNUstepOutput: dns_helper returns the reverse lookup of the hostname
 as well.

2005-06-09 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * GNUstepOutput: Added a helper tool class to ease use of external
 tools + distributed objects.

 Moved /server dns look ups to a helper tool

 Added /alias,/unalias and a default set of aliases

 * NetclassesInput: Added a warning when using a package version < 1.04

 * Highlighting: Added back in the preferences to new preferences system.

 * DCCSupport: Added back in the preferences to new preferences system

2005-06-08 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * GNUstepOutput: Changed /scrollback lines to work with new scrollback
 history mechanism.  Obsoleted several unused preferences. ;)

 * GNUstepOutput: Added Tools/ directory for various helper tools.
 Began exec_helper (A tool to help with /exec)

 * GNUstepOutput: Added /exec and /exec -o commands

2005-06-05 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * GNUstepOutput: Fixed history corruption when closing tab with /close.
 Fixed notifications when removing tabs so that new selection is sent out
 as well.

2005-06-02 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * GNUstepOutput: Added a method to InputController to allow a command to
 be executed (programmatically) without making it into the history or messing
 up what the person is currently typing.

 Added support for // to escape normal command handling:
 //dev/hda is cool
 would send
 /dev/hda is cool
 to the channel.

 Fixed autoconnect commands for autoconnected servers.

 Fixed InputController's hold on ConnectionController when
 a ContentController is given a new ConnectionController

 Got rid of some used methods in ConnectionController pertaining to
 InputController

 Made InputController stop throwing things in the history.

 Added Favorites item to the server list that always stays on top.

 Added support for s// style tab completion

2005-06-01 Andrew Ruder <aeruder@ksu.edu>
 * GNUstepOutput: Topic inspector did not correctly update
 when someone else applied a new topic.  Fixed several memory leaks
 between interactions with ConnectionController and the ContentControllers.

 Should drop connections correctly when window is closed.  Added a default
 quit message preference and added to General preferences UI.  Added a dealloc
 routine for the StandardContentController class.  Fixed double initialization
 of the UI for QueryViewControllers and ChannelViewControllers.

2004-01-12 Andy Ruder <aeruder at ksu dot edu>
 * Manually applying various attributes to NSTextView subclasses
   since OS X doesn't support custom subclasses on them.
 * Added the emoticon bundle (thanks ludovic)
 * Fixed a memory leak in bundle setup
 * Fixed a weirdness on selection in bundle setup

2004-01-11 Andy Ruder <aeruder at ksu dot edu>

   setting the block size.  A GNUstepOutput preferences panel was added.

2004-01-10 Andy Ruder <aeruder at ksu dot edu>

   things working on the OSX port.
 * Slightly modified bundle loading to search for bundles in the .app resource
   path.  Will make things simpler to produce distributable binary for
   TalkSoup at some other time for OSX.

2003-12-15 Andy Ruder <aeruder at ksu dot edu>
 * Lots of minor fixes to get OSX working.
 * Got Preferences, Bundle Setup, Channels, User lists working on OSX.

 * Bundle setup now auto applies its changes.

2003-12-13 Andy Ruder <aeruder at ksu dot edu>
 * I am a retard.  I did not realize that outlets do not have an automatic
   retain when assigned to the instance variable.  Therefore I should be
   releasing those things either!  The only reason it worked was due to a
   GNUstep mem-leak.  I am a retard!
 * Fixed a bug with DCC file transfer support where it never would download
   without an explicit directory given on the /dcc get line.
