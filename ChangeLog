 be executed (programmatically) without making it into the history or messing
 up what the person is currently typing.

 //dev/hda is cool
 would send
 /dev/hda is cool
 to the channel.

 a ContentController is given a new ConnectionController

 routine for the StandardContentController class.  Fixed double initialization
