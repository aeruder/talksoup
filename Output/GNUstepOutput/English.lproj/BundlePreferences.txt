Welcome to the TalkSoup Plugin Preferences.

TalkSoup is a highly-modular IRC client, and parts of it can be loaded and unloaded while it is running.  These optional parts are called plugins (or bundles).  There are two sets of bundles.  The first set, the input bundles, affect data coming into the IRC client. The second set, the output bundles, affect the data leaving the IRC client.  The pop up button located at the top is used to change which of these sets are being configured.

Above are two tables of bundles.  On the left, there is a table showing the loaded bundles and the order they are loaded in.  On the right, there is a table showing the bundles which can be loaded but currently are not.  You may click and drag these various bundles to/from the table on the left to load/unload them.

All the changes will be automatically applied to TalkSoup and saved for the next time TalkSoup is opened.

Clicking on any bundle will show information about that bundle in this text area.
