===============================================================================
TalkSoup.app is a fully-featured IRC client which uses GNUstep base.  While
TalkSoup.app itself is just a very basic core which can simply pass messages
between bundles (plugins).

This distribution comes with:

Input Plugins:

  *NetclassesInput: an input plugin based on netclasses

Output Plugins:

  *GNUstepOutput: an output plugin based on gnustep-gui

Input Filters:
  
  *Highlighting: highlights keywords and nicknames and 
    handles highlighting tabs as well
  
  MessageInTab: opens a new tab when someone private
    messages you
	
* == Used by default

===============================================================================
Commands: 

/load <in/out> <bundle>: 
  Loads a input/output filter bundle named <bundle>.  If that bundle
  is already loaded, it will move it to the end of the list.

/unload <in/out> <bundle>:
  Unloads a input/output filter bundle named <bundle>

/loaded :
  Shows what bundles are currently loaded

/saveloaded :
  Saves the currently loaded bundles to the defaults so that
  the same ones will be loaded upon the next startup of 
  TalkSoup.app

/join <channel1>[,channel2,...] [password1[,password2,...]]
  Joins a channel (optionally 2 or more channels separated
  by commas with no space) with an optional password (or
  if there are multiple channels specified, then multiple
  passwords separated only by a comma)

/nick <nick>
  Changes your nickname to <nick>

/msg <nick> <message>
  Sends the private message <message> to the person named <nick>

/quit <message>
  Disconnects you from the currently connected IRC server.  If 
  <message> is specified, it will use that as the quit message.

/notice <nick> <message>
  Sends the private notice <message> to the person named <nick>
  Most of the time, you should send people regular messages using
  the /msg command.  However, in certain cases, you may want to
  use a notice instead.

/away <message>
  This command sets your away message if <message> is specified.  If you
  don't specify <message>, it will mark you as back.

/colors
  This simply explains to you the valid colors that other commands may
  ask you to use.
  
===============================================================================
Commands specific to the GNUstep output plugin (GNUstepOutput)

/me <action>
  Sends an action to the channel, for example:
  
    /me runs around the channel screaming 'GNUstep rules'
  
  would print * <nick> runs around the channel screaming 'GNUstep rules'

/query <nick>
  Opens a new tab for a person named <nick>.  All of their private 
  messages will appear in there, and typing to the person in that tab
  will send them private messages.

/server <server> [port]
  Disconnects from current server and connects to <server>.  If
  [port] is unspecified, it defaults to 6667.

/close [name]
  This closes the tab named [name].  If you don't specify the name, it will
  close the current tab.

/clear
  Clears the text in the current tab.
  
===============================================================================
Notes about GNUstepOutput (default):
  
	* Double clicking a person in the user list in a channel will
	  open a query tab for them.
	* To switch tabs you hit command-left and command-right to move
	  to the left and right, respectively.
