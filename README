===============================================================================
TalkSoup.app is a fully-featured IRC client which uses GNUstep base.  While
TalkSoup.app itself is just a very basic core which can simply pass messages
between plugins.

This distribution comes with:

Input Plugins:

  *NetclassesInput.bundle: an input plugin based on netclasses

Output Plugins:

  *GNUstepOutput.bundle: an output plugin based on gnustep-gui

Input Filters:
  
  *Highlighting.bundle: highlights keywords and nicknames and 
    handles highlighting tabs as well
  
  MessageInTab.bundle: opens a new tab when someone private
    messages you
	
* == Used by default

===============================================================================
Commands: 

/load <in/out> <bundle>: 
  Loads a input/output filter bundle named <bundle>.  If that bundle
  is already loaded, it will move it to the end of the list.

/unload <in/out> <bundle>:
  Unloads a input/output filter bundle named <bundle>

/loaded :
  Shows what bundles are currently loaded

/saveloaded :
  Saves the currently loaded bundles to the defaults so that
  the same ones will be loaded upon the next startup of 
  TalkSoup.app

/join <channel1>[,channel2,...] [password1[,password2,...]]
  Joins a channel (optionally 2 or more channels separated
  by commas with no space) with an optional password (or
  if there are multiple channels specified, then multiple
  passwords separated only by a comma)

/me <action>
  Sends an action to the channel, for example:
  
    /me runs around the channel screaming 'GNUstep rules'
  
  would print * <nick> runs around the channel screaming 'GNUstep rules'

/nick <nick>
  Changes your nickname to <nick>

/server <server> [port]
  Disconnects from current server and connects to <server>.  If
  [port] is unspecified, it defaults to 6667.

/query <nick>
  Opens a new tab for a person named <nick>.  All of their private 
  messages will appear in there, and typing to the person in that tab
  will send them private messages.

/msg <nick> <message>
  Sends the private message <message> to the person named <nick>

===============================================================================
Notes about GNUstepOutput.bundle (default):
  
	* Double clicking a person in the user list in a channel will
	  open a query tab for them.
	* To switch tabs you hit command-left and command-right to move
	  to the left and right, respectively.
