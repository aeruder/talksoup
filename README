===============================================================================
TalkSoup.app is a fully-featured IRC client which uses GNUstep base.  While
TalkSoup.app itself is just a very basic core which can simply pass messages
between bundles (plugins).

This distribution comes with:

Input Plugins:

  *NetclassesInput: an input plugin based on netclasses

Output Plugins:

  *GNUstepOutput: an output plugin based on gnustep-gui

Input Filters:
  
  *Highlighting: highlights keywords and nicknames and 
    handles highlighting tabs as well.  See the /highlighting
    command for configuration options. (Bundle must be loaded)

  *KeepAlive: sends a ping to the server every three minutes
    on every connection to keep you connected
  
  MessageInTab: opens a new tab when someone private
    messages you

  Decolorizer: removes colors from incoming messages.

  Debold: removes bold from incoming messages

  Deunderline: removes underlining from incoming messages
  
Output Filters:

  *Colorizer: Lets you use %B for bold, %U for underline,
    %O for clear all attributes, and %C(0-15),(0-15) to set
    colors. (First number is the foreground color, second number 
    is the background color).

  Piper: Lets you pipe outgoing messages through arbitrary
    commands. See the /piper command when the bundle is loaded
    to configure.

* == Used by default

===============================================================================
Commands: 

/load <in/out> <bundle>: 
  Loads a input/output filter bundle named <bundle>.  If that bundle
  is already loaded, it will move it to the end of the list.

/unload <in/out> <bundle>:
  Unloads a input/output filter bundle named <bundle>

/loaded :
  Shows what bundles are currently loaded

/saveloaded :
  Saves the currently loaded bundles to the defaults so that
  the same ones will be loaded upon the next startup of 
  TalkSoup.app

/join <channel1>[,channel2,...] [password1[,password2,...]]
  Joins a channel (optionally 2 or more channels separated
  by commas with no space) with an optional password (or
  if there are multiple channels specified, then multiple
  passwords separated only by a comma)

/nick <nick>
  Changes your nickname to <nick>

/msg <nick> <message>
  Sends the private message <message> to the person named <nick>

/quit <message>
  Disconnects you from the currently connected IRC server.  If 
  <message> is specified, it will use that as the quit message.

/notice <nick> <message>
  Sends the private notice <message> to the person named <nick>
  Most of the time, you should send people regular messages using
  the /msg command.  However, in certain cases, you may want to
  use a notice instead.

/away <message>
  This command sets your away message if <message> is specified.  If you
  don't specify <message>, it will mark you as back.

/colors
  This simply explains to you the valid colors that other commands may
  ask you to use.

/ctcp <nick> <ctcp> [args]
  Sends the ctcp command <ctcp> with optional arguments [args] to
  the person with the nick <nick>.  CTCP messages are used for a
  lot of extensions to IRC such as DCC and getting information
  from another person's IRC client.

/version <nick>
  This is a sortcut for /ctcp <nick> VERSION, which, on most
  IRC clients, will return the person named <nick>'s IRC client 
  and version.

/clientinfo <nick>
  This is a shortcut for /ctcp <nick> CLIENTINFO, which, on
  most IRC clients, will return information on getting the
  IRC client that the person named <nick> is using.

/ping <nick> <argument>
  This is a shortcut for /ctcp <nick> PING <argument>.  With
  most IRC clients, the other client will respond immediately
  with a PING CTCP message with the same argument.  You can
  use this to see how lagged you are.

/userinfo <nick>
  This is a shortcut for /ctcp <nick> USERINFO.  On some
  IRC clients this will respond with information about the
  user named <nick>.

/topic <channel> [topic]
  This will set <channel>'s topic to [topic].  If [topic] is
  not specified, it will refresh the channel's topic.

/kick <channel> <user> [comment]
  This will kick the specified <user> out of a <channel>.  If
  [comment] is specified, it will be displayed to the user
  instead of the default message.

/raw <message>
  This command will send <message> to the server as it is, 
  no formatting or command substitution will take place on
  the string.

===============================================================================
Commands specific to the GNUstep output plugin (GNUstepOutput)

/me <action>
  Sends an action to the channel, for example:
  
    /me runs around the channel screaming 'GNUstep rules'
  
  would print * <nick> runs around the channel screaming 'GNUstep rules'

/query <nick>
  Opens a new tab for a person named <nick>.  All of their private 
  messages will appear in there, and typing to the person in that tab
  will send them private messages.

/server <server> [port]
  Disconnects from current server and connects to <server>.  If
  [port] is unspecified, it defaults to 6667.

/close [name]
  This closes the tab named [name].  If you don't specify the name, it will
  close the current tab.

/clear
  Clears the text in the current tab.

/scrollback <characters>
  This sets how many characters your scroll-back buffer holds.
  This change will automatically be saved to the defaults.
  
===============================================================================
Notes about GNUstepOutput (default):
  
	* Double clicking a person in the user list in a channel will
	  open a query tab for them.
	* To switch tabs you hit command-left and command-right to move
	  to the left and right, respectively.
